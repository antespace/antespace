### Hello ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm Chris, a Full-Stack developer working primarily within the .NET/C# ecosphere with 10+ years of development experience across multiple industries. Things are a little sparse right now while I orient myself here. 

In the meantime, you can see my resume on [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-in%2Fchristopherlau-blue?style=social&logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherlau/) or tweet at
